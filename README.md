# EventWeaver
A unity asset that allows for sequential Unity Events

There are no docs, but its pretty straight forward.
Just drag the EventManager into your scene. And you can start with the 2D Event Prefabs to start making events.
Variables and Switches are scriptable objects.

Demo of this asset in use:
